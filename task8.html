     <h2>H. Cloud Computing and Automation</h2>
<p><b>     H01.</b> 
Scenario involves water usage and temperature data
- For one house
- For one neighborhood
- For one city (multiple neighborhoods)
• Each team works with a “gateway” database
- Gateway can represent the data for one house
- “historical” data for house/can be generated
- Current sensor data can be generated or using sensor(s) on the participant’s own device
• “Cloud” database can also be created to represent the consolidation of the gateway databases, which would represent all the homes
</p>
<p><b>H02.</b> 
Work with the local gateway data and correlate the temperature and water consumption data for one home
• Establish real world scenario around cost savings (examples)
- Water more than XXX gallons per month is more expensive
- Water delivered during peak hours is more expensive
- Water delivered when temperature exceeds a threshold is more expensive
• Define thresholds/triggers to respond to the sensor data and the analytics
- When to water the lawn
- When to activate the clothes washer, dishwasher, etc.
• Build a (dashboard?) application to allow the home owner to interact with the data
- See what is going on – real time and historical
- Establish thresholds/triggers/actions to activate lawn sprinklers, washing machine, dishwashers, fill swimming pool, etc.
• Incorporate the Cloud (city level) data to provide comparisons between local house and the entire city
</p>


<p><b>H03.</b> 
• Work with the Cloud data and correlate the temperature and water consumption data for the city
• Determine some capacity and cost valuations for water resources (examples)
- How much water can the system deliver?
- Potable water could be more expensive than non-potable water. Some ways to analyze the data with these variations.
• Establish real world scenario around this data (examples)
- Which neighborhoods/homes use the most water?
- Relationships between temperature and water consumption
- Forecasting future water usage based on previous water usage and temperature data
- Forecasting infrastructure enhancements in water delivery system to be able to
• This approach involves creative analytics on the data and developing ways to present it.
</p>
<p><b>H04.</b>
• Scenario involves weather forecasting
- Uses barometer, temperature and humidity sensors on iOS and Android devices
• Develop application to display this data on the mobile device
• Upload data to the “Cloud” database
- Historical sensor data can be generated
- We can locate a real weather dataset to be used for historical data
• Develop some strategy to correlate the data and a mechanism to present it. 
</p>
<p><b>H05.</b>
• Scenario involves a home security system
• Virtual sensors generating data for:
- Doors and windows opening and closing
- Lights on and off
- Smoke alarm on and off
- More ….
• Virtual sensors upload data to the home “gateway” database
• Develop (mobile?) application to display to view the status of the home and to (virtually) interact with various components: (examples)
- Arm and disarm the security system
- Turn on/off the lights
- Turn off the lawn sprinklers
- Develop some other views of the data and a mechanism to present it
</p>
<p><b>H06.</b>
• Scenario involves a parking garage assigning parking spaces
• Each parking space is instrumented, for example:
- Occupied/empty
- Time of event
• Each car could have some identifier (RFID?)
• Virtual arrival and departure of cars at various times
• Some percentage of cars represent short term parkers (shoppers) vs. some are long term parkers (workers)
- Program assigns parking spots
• Virtual sensors upload data to the garage “gateway” database
• Mobile program for driver to view parking garage, parking space assignment and fee for parking
• Administration program viewing all the parking assignments and billing
• “Cloud” database would represent consolidated view of all of the parking garages in the city
• Cloud database would help city planners:
- Capacity planning – are there enough parking spaces?
- How many cars are turned away?
- Billing strategy – higher charges for peak hours?
• This approach involves creative analytics on the data and developing ways to present it.
</p>
<p><b>H07.</b>
• Scenario involves a delivery company truck fleet maintenance
• Each truck is instrumented, for example:
- Mileage
- Weight
- Fuel level
- Tire pressure
- Time
- Driver
• Virtual truck assignments at various times
- Various distances and weights
• Virtual sensors upload each trip’s data to the trucking company’s “gateway” database
• Gateway database also maintains (examples)
- Which trucks are in service?
- Service intervals
- Fuel usage
- Tire replacement
- Driver information (how many hours driven and using which trucks)
• Mobile program for driver to view current status and maintenance history of current truck
• Administration program viewing status for all the trucks
- Which trucks are not available because they are in the shop?
</p>
<p><b>H08.</b> 
• Scenario involves a health care monitoring device which reads (for example)
- Heart rate
- Blood pressure
- Respiration
- Oxygen levels
• Virtual sensors upload data to the hospital floor’s “gateway” database
• Data for some of these sensors should be arriving each second 
• Need to respond to urgent situations (heart rate = 0) in real time
• Dashboard type program to allow monitoring of each patient from central location
- Mechanism to establish individual alert thresholds for each patient
- View historical data as well as current data.
