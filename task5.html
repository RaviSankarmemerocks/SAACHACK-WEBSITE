<h2> E. Smart Cities:</h2>

<h2>E01. Intelligent Traffic Information System</h2> 

<u>Description:</u> <p>A real time traffic information collection and monitoring system for improved road transportation is the objective of this problem statement. The architecture of the system employs Internet of Things (IoT), Sensor Network, RFID, GPS, cloud computing etc. The proposed system is based on IoT and the data collected from large number of sensors and RFIDs is transmitted wirelessly. IoT helps in improving traffic conditions, safety, efficiency and cost of implementation.
</p>
<h2>E02. Automated Public Transportation System with e-Billing for the Smart Cities </h2>
<u>Description:</u><p> In public transportation system at present we use paper tickets which are printed by a small machine with a key pad. In this system we don’t know the details of passengers who are using the public transport. The system requires user details in order to provide security during identification process. The details are also required in order to provide notifications via SMS to the user. The problem statement is automatic ticketing with e-billing through IoT technologies.
</p>
<h2>E03. Automatic Path Navigation for the Wheel Chair/ Vehicle.</h2>
<u>Description:</u> <p>The objective of this theme is to develop an intelligent wheelchair system to support safe mobility for disabled or elderly people with various impairments. This model must have two main functions: obstacle detection and avoidance, and situation recognition. 
</p>
<h2>E04. Driver-less Car.</h2>

<u>Description:</u> <p>The objective of this problem statement is to develop a prototype model of an autonomous car or driverless car that uses a combination of sensors, cameras, radar and artificial intelligence (AI) to travel between destinations without a human operator.</p> 

<h2>E05. An Intelligent Accident Avoidance System.</h2>

<u>Description:</u></p>The objective of this theme is to make the automobiles with more interactive and intelligent for avoiding accidents on roads. In order to prevent from accidents, different sensors are used to observe fatigue levels of driver, pulse rate, alcohol level, obstacle detection and also sudden collisions. 
</p>
<h2>E06. Smart Farming</h2>

<u>Description:</u><p> The aim of this problem statement is to develop a IoT based  system for Smart Agriculture.  The system should assist the farmers in getting Live Data (Temperature, Soil Moisture etc.,) for efficient environment monitoring which will enable them to do smart farming and increase their overall yield and quality of products.
</p>
<h2>E07. Smart System for Food Safety Management</h2>

<u>Description: </u><p>Today’s globalization of food production chains, their extensive complexity and limitations arising from manual insertion and data processing of products information make it impossible for consumers the task of being informed in real-time. This obstacle can be overcome, and the current level of technology and low implementation costs allow full automation of this process. The objective of this problem statement is to develop a sensors network architecture based on Internet of Things (IoT) components, which is using autonomous embedded modules and radio identification tags (RFID) that will automatically collect data, covering the entire life cycle of the food product and all the factors that influence its chemical composition</p>

<h2>E08. Smart Waste Management System:</h2> 

<u>Description:</u> <p>Waste management from its inception to its disposal is one of the important challenges for the municipal corporations in all over the world. Smart waste management is an idea where we can control lots of problems which disturbs the society in pollution and diseases. The waste management has to be done instantly else it leads to irregular management which will have adverse effect on nature. The Smart waste management is compatible mainly with concept of smart cities. Smart Dust-bin systems are the primary method to collect waste. The main objectives of smart waste management system includes : 1. Monitoring the waste management. 2. Route planning for garbage collection,. 3. Avoiding human intervention. 4. Reducing human time and effort 5. Resulting in healthy and waste ridden environment.</p>

<h2>E09. Smart and Intelligent Home Automation with Customized Settings:</h2>

<u>Description:</u> <p>Internet of Things (IoT) allows us to implement home automation system that can be controlled remotely through internet. The proposed system can monitor different parameters like gas, light, motion detection, temperature, etc. using the sensor data and also trigger a process according to the requirement. The data from the sensors are uploaded to a cloud server and this data can be used to analyze the parameters.</p>
<h2>E10. Development of Smart System for Women Safety</h2>

<u>Description:</u><p>Today in the current global scenario, the prime question in every girl's mind, considering the ever rising increase of issues on women harassment in recent past is mostly about her safety and security. The aim of this theme is to develop a device which is the integration of multiple devices, hardware comprises of a wearable “Gadget” which continuously monitor the scenarios around the girl and stream the data whenever there is a need.</p> 

<h2>E11. Development Smart System for the Remote Health Monitoring of Elderly Patients</h2>

<u>Description:</u><p> In a world with an accelerated population aging, there is an increasingly interest in developing solutions for the elderly living assistance. The Internet of Things is a new reality that is completely changing our everyday life and promises to revolutionize modern healthcare by enabling a more personalized, preventive and collaborative form of care. Aiming to combine these two important topics, this problem statement presents an IoT-ready solution for the elderly living assistance which is able to monitor and register patient’s vital information as well as to provide mechanisms to trigger alarms in emergency situations.
</p>
<h2>E12. Smart System for Hazardous Gas Detection</h2>

<u>Description: </u><p>The core objective of the Smart City mission is to develop the clean and sustainable solution that helps to improve the quality of the living environment. No city can be smart without the smart sewage management system. Sewer gas is a complex mixture of toxic and nontoxic gases produced and collected in sewage systems by the decomposition of organic household or industrial wastes, typical components of sewage. High concentrations of hydrogen sulfide (>150 ppm) can produce olfactory fatigue, whereby the scent becomes undetectable. At higher concentrations (>300 ppm), hydrogen sulfide can cause loss of consciousness and death. Very high concentrations (>1000 ppm) can result in immediate collapse, occurring after a single breath. In worst cases, it may lead to the collapse of the structure with significant cost for its rehabilitation. The objective of this problem statement is to develop a model to detect the hazardous gas level in remote locations using sensors and send these data to the centralized server to monitor.
