      <b>What is a selection criteria? </b>
      
      <p>Evaluation criteria will consist of novelty of the thought, complexity, clearness and details in the prescribed format, feasibility, practicability, sustainability, scale of impact, user experience and potential for future work progression. Preferences will be given to entries from Northeast while selecting between two similar ideas.</p>
      <b>What is Judging Criteria?</b>
      <p>1. TECHNOLOGY: How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?<br>

2.  DESIGN: Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? For a website, this might be about how beautiful the CSS or graphics are. For a hardware project, it might be more about how good the human-computer interaction is? <br>

3.  COMPLETION: Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before? If a team which always does virtual reality projects decides to switch up and try doing a mobile app instead, that exploration should be rewarded.<br>

4.  LEARNING: Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?<br>
